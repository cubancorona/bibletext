# Backlog

Deferred work, one entry per item. An entry carries enough scope to be picked
up cold; delete it when the work lands.

## Bible version states: transition diagram + comprehensive tests

**Storage space DONE 2026-08-28** — `docs/VERSION_STATES.md` models the machine
and `version_state_flow_test.go` enumerates it (15 cells, every one reached,
zero incoherent states standing). The enumeration found and closed V1 (an
unusable current-epoch cache served the previous epoch silently, with the
refresh switched off and the picker mute) and its root cause V2 (a cache write
renamed without an fsync).

Two spaces remain to enumerate, both scouted with the cells already chosen:

- **The launch space** — storage shape x saved-reading x seed-usability x
  fetch outcome, driven through `loadStartupBible`, which takes its three
  loaders as parameters and is therefore already injectable.
- **The download space** — `fullPending` x `seedOnly` x `fullDownloading` x
  backoff delay, across the apply / retry / foreground / picker-open events,
  built on an `AppState` literal.

### Reported defects — status, severity, and the order to take them

Each was raised while scouting the runtime and cache lanes. **PROBED** means the
scout executed it against a copy of the repo; **TRACED** means it is a code walk
with exact paths but no execution. None is claimed in docs/VERSION_STATES.md,
because that document only names what the enumeration has driven. Confirm each
with a cell as its space is enumerated.

| # | Defect | Evidence | Costs the reader | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~D1~~ | ~~`purgeUnavailableLicensedCaches` deletes on an answer the app could not verify~~ | **CONFIRMED by the M2 enumeration and FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D2~~ | ~~Superseded epochs of a licensed version are never age-checked and never purged~~ | **FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D3~~ | ~~A non-default translation served from a superseded epoch is silently stale~~ | **FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D4~~ | ~~`seedOnly` is not cleared when the download lands while the reader is away~~ | **CONFIRMED by the M3 trajectory walk and FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D5~~ | ~~The picker's manual retry makes the waiting notice unreachable~~ | **CONFIRMED by a reachability assertion and FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D6~~ | ~~A successful fetch that cannot be persisted is discarded entirely~~ | **FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D7~~ | ~~Registry-resolved vs value-resolved cache paths can collide~~ | **GUARDED 2026-08-28** | — | done |
| ~~D8~~ | ~~The cache-only read's miss branches disagree about the mode~~ | **FIXED 2026-08-28** | — | done |

**All eight are closed** (2026-08-28), each confirmed against real code and
fixed with a test that fails without the fix. What remains of this item is
enumeration, not defects: **M4** (active selection), **M5–M7** (launch,
reading position, canon shape — the history-erasure territory, and the machine
whose own mapping table is documented as lying), and the **arrivals layer**
(links, notes, search results landing on all of the above). The trajectory
harness in `version_refresh_flow_test.go` is the pattern for those, since the
defects there will be flow-shaped rather than cell-shaped.

## NKJV Psalm superscriptions

The NKJV prints the Psalm titles too, but its API.Bible feed delivers them as
`d` (descriptive title) paragraphs, which decodeAPIBiblePassage currently
skips via apiBibleSkipPara. Rendering them means capturing `d` content into
BibleData.Superscriptions during the passages walk (anchoring any note
markers the way the helloao branch does), bumping the nkjv cacheEpoch, and
nothing else — the renderers and the section already handle titles for every
version. Worth batching with the next NKJV decode change.
